For Tourists, the documents differ a little and include a passport, visa with entry stamp, a valid home country driving license, and an international driving permit or international driving license. However, if you hold GCC, US, UK, or Canada passports, as well as some other countries’ passports, you can drive with your home country’s license.\n

To know if you are eligible to rent a car in Dubai, please ensure that your driving license is valid for driving in the UAE.`,
